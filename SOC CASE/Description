# SOC Case Study — Splunk Multi-Platform Log Analysis

This project demonstrates practical SOC analysis using Splunk to monitor, analyze, and visualize security logs from multiple platforms including Apache Web Server, MacOS, Linux, Health App, and OpenSSH server environments.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Centralize log data from diverse systems
- Detect anomalies, brute-force attacks, and unauthorized activities
- Build dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Compare Splunk with alternative SIEM/log analysis tools
- Provide mitigation recommendations to improve security posture

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
| Tool / Feature | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Splunk Enterprise** | Log ingestion & security dashboarding |
| **SPL (Search Processing Language)** | Querying and analysis |
| **Splunk Security Essentials** | Threat content packs & detections |
| **Cyber Security Essentials App** | Visual threat monitoring dashboards |
| **Windows 11 System Monitoring** | Host security visualization |

---

## 🔍 Log Sources Analyzed
| Log Source | Key Use Case |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Apache Web Server** | Traffic monitoring & threat geolocation |
| **MacOS System Logs** | Hardware/USB activity, Wi-Fi abuse |
| **Linux Logs** | Service failures, suspicious network connections |
| **Health App Logs** | Data integrity & unusual behavior detection |
| **OpenSSH Server Logs** | SSH brute-force attack identification |

---

## 📊 Visual Dashboards Created
✔ Geo-maps of attacker origin  
✔ Time-series for peak traffic or login attempts  
✔ Service monitoring and stability issues  
✔ USB device behavior patterns  
✔ Authentication logging trends  

> All dashboards and figures are included in `splunk-analysis-report.pdf`

## 🔥 “Wow Factor”
Advanced Splunk apps were installed and configured to simulate professional SOC workflows:

- **Splunk Security Essentials**
  - Automated phishing indicators
  - Threat investigation playbooks
  - Account compromise analytics

- **Cyber Security Essentials App**
  - Live threat dashboards
  - APT groups, malware categories, triggered alerts

- **Windows 11 Host Monitoring**
  - Restart/shutdown tracking
  - Stability and compromise detection

---

## 🧩 Key Findings
- Multiple SSH brute-force attempts detected and mapped by region
- Suspicious late-night health app logs indicating automation misuse
- High-volume Apache traffic suggesting scanning activity
- System wake events and USB behavior on Mac indicating possible reconnaissance

---

## 🛡️ Security Recommendations
| Improvement | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| MFA & stricter authentication | Reduce credential compromise |
| USB device restrictions | Prevent data exfiltration |
| Alerting on geo-based SSH anomalies | Faster threat response |
| Firmware + OS updates | Improve endpoint resilience |
| Log retention & centralization | Better forensic readiness |
