# Network Design & Core Services Configuration

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a small business network, including subnetting, DHCP, DNS, and email server functionality. The network was planned and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Design a functional network for 3 subnets
- Configure core network services for host communication
- Verify secure and reliable end-to-end connectivity

---

## 🧩 Subnet Design
An IPv4 address block was subnetted to support 3 networks, with correct:
- Network addresses
- Host ranges
- Broadcast addresses
- Subnet mask (/27)

Subnet planning table included in the full report.

## ⚙️ Configured Network Services
| Service | Function |
|--------|----------|
| DHCP | Automated IP assignment for clients |
| DNS | Resolving hostnames to IP addresses |
| SMTP / POP3 Email | End-to-end communication between hosts |
| Static Routing | Multi-subnet communication |

---

## 🔍 Connectivity Verification
- Ping tests between hosts successful
- Email exchanged successfully through configured server
- Router successfully routed traffic between subnets
